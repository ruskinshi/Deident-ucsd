'''
This will contain the code that will run the deidenitifcation software
on the list of provided images.

Currently, since the deidenitifcation software doesn't ouput the images into
one single directory (due to some internal grouping algo), we will circumvent
that by simply just running one image at a time and moving that image to the 
proper directory

Steps are:
for each image
1) copy it to a new temp directory
2) run the deidenitifcation on it
3) find the deidentified image
4) move it to the proper output directory
5) delete the directory the deidentified image was in
